The are a couple of known bugs. Here are a ranked list of them starting with the most severe ones.

Client receiving pong:
    due to only one client being able to listen to a socket file path at a time, if a client gets no pong response from mipd, 
    it will simply hang and block all other pong responses to the clients trying to connect later in the queue.
    In the test script provided. The thirdd client is trying to connect to a host not directly connected to its own host.
    It therefore hangs and blocks the fourth client from receiving its pong. 
    The two first clients both get a pong sicne their destination hosts is connected to their own hosts.
    This bug only affects the pong receiving of the client applications. It does not affect the mipd or the server application for receiving pings.

Memory management:
    Buffer overflows and memory leaks might happen.
